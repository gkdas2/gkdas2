I am Ghanendra (Manish), a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology's DICELab. I am interested in developing differentiable computational models for a variety of tightly coupled systems and optimization methods (MDO) to augment engineering design of next generation aircrafts. So far, I have explored MDO architectures (my masters thesis) as well as aerostructural topology optimization for highly flexible aircraft wings.

Recenlty, I've been working on non-intuitive structural design of the vehicle airframe for crashworthiness consideration during initial design phase. By implementing topology optimization approach, the idea is to locally control the structural properties such that enhanced energy-attenuating capability is embedded into the chassis structure itself. I've embarked on a long journey to develop an AD-assisted FE framework for dynamic crash simulation of VTOLs with Crashworthiness parameters as cost functions since there doesn't seem to be anything available.

Watch this space for updates.
