I am a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology's DICELab. I develop scalable computational algorithms and frameworks for MDO (multidisciplinary design optimization) of fixed-wing aircrafts and eVTOL vehicles. I perform high-fidelity shape and topology optimization for reduced drag, weight, and recently, crashworthiness.
